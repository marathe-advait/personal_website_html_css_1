    I am a tech enthusiast and I always look forward to new learning oppurtunities.I have previously worked on many technologies such as 
    <em> <strong> <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Python </a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>.</strong> </em>
    I have also created projects on technologies such as <em> <strong> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>, 
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a>.</strong> </em> Apart from being a tech enthusiast, I love to connect with new people. I always look forward to listen to their stories and get inspired everyday.
    I believe is that true success is the one which is achieved by growing on your own and by supporting others to do the same.

                    batteries and weighs out the pros and cons of the same. Finally, the project proposes a novel
                    Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN) approach and the comparative analysis is carried out.
